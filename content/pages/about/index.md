Hi I'm Joshua,

I'm from Manchester, UK, but I currently live in the midlands somewhere between Derby and Birmingham.

I hold a **BEng in Mechanical Engineering and an Msc in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial management**.

I have years of experience in managing the development of physical products from turbochargers made in their millions, to super luxury cars made one of a kind.

I have managed programmes and projects from £1m to £250m and delivered some of the best loved luxury cars today at **Aston Martin Lagonda**.

I left Aston Martin in 2019 and I'm making the transition to software engineering in 2020.

**I was lucky enough to find a great remote job** with the basics that I already knew, and now I'm making 2020 the year I learn to build professional web apps.

The tools I am learning are:

- JS / ReactJS.
- Redux.
- Typescript.
- CSS / SASS.
- Node, Express.
- MongoDB.
- I can use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, and TailwindCSS.
- I am also able to write python for engineering and web applications.

I'm currently following the curriculum at [freecodecamp.org](http://www.freecodecamp.org)

Outside of my day job I'm open to projects physical product and software related.
